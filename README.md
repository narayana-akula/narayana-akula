<h1>Hi, Am Narayana <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cybersecurity-professional-narayana-murthy">Cybersecurity Professional</a>

## A brief of my journey to be here...

It all started with a break post stressful journey of being a "Design Engineer" under "Semiconductor" field. Started giving attempts to crack ICRB and for those how don't know about ICRB, is for landing into most valuable and ever dreamt government job at ISRO. Out of the blue moon, couldn't achieve and made up with a decision not to drag the career gap. That is when I started looking for various domains that are trending in market and in the midst of that research, got to hear about a completely unknown term "Cybersecurity".
Being lucky enough to have access to a great resource "Internet", could dig more to understand and with a light research has brought me to gain interest and started digging more about sub-domains and it's real meaning in practical terms. That small research made me to take up with this as this has the scope of putting us in different scenarios unlike in other domains and a continuous learning scope to be more attracted to it.
